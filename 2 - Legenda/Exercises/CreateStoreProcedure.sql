/*
[ @stmt= ] statement
Is a Unicode string that contains a Transact-SQL statement or batch. @stmt must be either a Unicode constant or a Unicode variable. 
More complex Unicode expressions, such as concatenating two strings with the + operator, are not allowed. 
Character constants are not allowed. If a Unicode constant is specified, it must be prefixed with an N. 
For example, the Unicode constant N'sp_who' is valid, but the character constant 'sp_who' is not. 
The size of the string is limited only by available database server memory. On 64-bit servers, 
the size of the string is limited to 2 GB, the maximum size of nvarchar(max).
